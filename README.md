# Challenging-problem

I recently developed a Face Recognition Attendance System utilizing Python, OpenCV, and a database backend.

The initial obstacle was attaining precise face detection in diverse lighting situations and different camera perspectives.

I employed Haar Cascade for detection and LBPH for recognition, along with optimized preprocessing (grayscale conversion and histogram equalization) to address this.

A significant obstacle was creating a complete data pipeline from live video capture → facial encoding → identification → attendance recording.

I also developed an automated attendance recording system using a structured backend linked to the UI.

Achieving quick processing while upholding precision necessitated adjusting thresholds and enhancing the recognition process.

This project enhanced my abilities in computer vision, model optimization, data pipeline development, and comprehensive problem-solving
